# libft

AND thus began my coding journey, libft is one of my first projects as a student at Hive helsinki :)

As a student at Hive we are encouraged to recreate C library functions to get a better understanding of them and to also be able to use them in later projects.
Already existing libc functions that we were allowed to use for this project were write, free and malloc.

The project gave me better understanding of different datatypes and memory allocation.

With time I have also expanded the library with my own functions and I will continue to do so.

# How to

Use the Makefile -make all to compile a libft.a file.

```
make all
```

The Makefile also includes clean (cleaning up object files), fclean(cleaning up object files and removing the libft.a file) and re (will do fclean and make all).
